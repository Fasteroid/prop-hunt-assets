## Props Beyond Infinity: Server Content
This repository contains all custom sounds and textures for my prop hunt server, Props Beyond Infinity. 
&nbsp;Pull requests are welcome provided they follow all applicable guidelines:<br>
### Taunt PR guidelines
 - Taunts must either use a sample rate of 44100hz or 22050hz. &nbsp;Source cannot play sounds of other sample rates!
 - Taunts should be thoughtfully categorized. &nbsp;For example, `sound/taunts/hunters/searching` is a good place for taunts conveying confusion.
 - Taunts naming should follow our naming convention. all spaces must be underscores &nbsp;For example, `sound/taunts/hunters/attacking/fuck_you.mp3` instead of `sound/taunts/hunters/attacking/fuck-you.mp3`.
 - Taunts should be under 15 seconds long. &nbsp;Longer taunts will likely be turned down.
