## Props Beyond Infinity: Server Content
This repository contains all custom sounds and textures for my prop hunt server, Props Beyond Infinity. 
&nbsp;Pull requests are welcome provided they follow all applicable guidelines:<br>
### Taunt PR guidelines
 - Taunts must either use a sample rate of 44100hz or 22050hz. &nbsp;Source cannot play sounds of other sample rates!
 - Taunts should be thoughtfully categorized. &nbsp;For example, `sound/taunts/hunters/searching` is a good place for taunts conveying confusion.
 - Taunts should be under 15 seconds long. &nbsp;Longer taunts are likely (but not guaranteed) to be rejected.
 - Taunts must follow the new naming conventions (5/24/2022):
   - Do not use spaces, **ever**! &nbsp;They are evil!
   - You may use underscores and *only* underscores in place of spaces.
   - Do not use capital letters. &nbsp;They are evil on Linux.
   - Use alphanumeric characters only.
